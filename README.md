## Winter and Summer events for MCME
This project is once again in development!

### Bug fixes
* Team Conquest - apparently it's bugged, but I don't know what specifically

### New features
* /pvp help - guide for setting up maps and starting games
* Keep track of sessions for players so they can be reassigned to the same team on rejoin
* /pvp assign <player> <team> to assign a player to a certain team in a running game
* /pvp warp <map name>

### Code improvements
* Simplify the command files so they're easier to read
* Tests? This might be a bit ambitious

Needed commands for wrapper:

Shell: mv plugins\update\MCME-Events-0.1.jar plugins\MCME-Events-0.1.jar

MSDOS: MOVE /y plugins\update\MCME-Events-0.1.jar plugins\MCME-Events-0.1.jar
